Every Chinese knows the importance of the college entrance examination,
so the high school students always can feel the stress from that exam,
especially when that day is nearby.
Some students will not do as well as usual because of heavy stress.
It is necessary to adjust their mood well before the exam.
They should not give too much pressure to themselves, instead of having usual heart.
Then they can do in working order.
To reach this goal,
they can spare time to do some sports or just go running and keep telling themselves that the exam canâ€™t decide their future,
so they try their best would be OK and no one will blame them.
The purpose is make them feel relax, as the status of relax is the best state for achieving good marks in the exam.
It is helpful so so so so so so so
